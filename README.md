# Pro Football Reference Player Scraper (AWS Scalable Pipeline)

A scalable scraping pipeline for collecting player statistics from **Pro-Football-Reference** using **FlareSolverr** to bypass Cloudflare protections.

Designed to run on **AWS ECS Fargate** with **SQS for job distribution** and **S3 for storage**.

---

# Architecture

Pipeline flow:

Player URL
↓
SQS Queue
↓
ECS Fargate Scraper Workers
↓
FlareSolverr Service
↓
S3 JSON Storage

This architecture allows you to scale horizontally by increasing the number of scraper workers.

Example scaling:

- 10 workers → 10 concurrent scrapes
- 100 workers → 100 concurrent scrapes

---

# Components

## FlareSolverr

Handles Cloudflare challenges.

Container image:

```
ghcr.io/flaresolverr/flaresolverr:latest
```

Runs as an ECS service or task.

Workers send requests to:

```
http://flaresolverr:8191/v1
```

---

## Scraper Worker

Consumes player URLs from SQS and performs:

1. Fetch page through FlareSolverr
2. Parse stat tables
3. Upload structured JSON to S3

Worker file:

```
worker.py
```

# Local Development

Start FlareSolverr locally:

```
docker run -d -p 8191:8191 ghcr.io/flaresolverr/flaresolverr
```

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run scraper manually:

```
python scraper.py https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BradTo00.htm
```

Output:

```
BradTo00.json
```

---

# AWS Deployment

## 1 Build Docker Image

```
docker build -t pfr-scraper .
```

---

## 2 Create ECR Repository

```
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name pfr-scraper
```

Login to ECR:

```
aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | \
 docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
```

Tag image:

```
docker tag pfr-scraper:latest <account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/pfr-scraper:latest
```

Push image:

```
docker push <account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/pfr-scraper:latest
```

---

# ECS Task Definitions

Located in:

```
aws/ecs/
```

Register tasks:

```
aws ecs register-task-definition \
--cli-input-json file://aws/ecs/flaresolverr-task.json

aws ecs register-task-definition \
--cli-input-json file://aws/ecs/scraper-task.json
```

---

# SQS Queue

Create queue:

```
aws sqs create-queue --queue-name pfr-player-urls
```

Example queue URL:

```
https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ACCOUNT/pfr-player-urls
```

---

# S3 Storage

Create bucket:

```
aws s3 mb s3://pfr-scraped-data
```

Output files stored as:

```
players/<player_id>.json
```

Example:

```
players/BradTo00.json
```

---

# Worker Environment Variables

Configure in ECS task definition.

```
SQS_QUEUE_URL=<queue_url>
S3_BUCKET=<bucket_name>
AWS_REGION=<region>
FLARESOLVERR_URL=http://flaresolverr:8191/v1
```

---

# Queue Player URLs

Helper script:

```
enqueue_players.py
```

Usage:

```
cat player_urls.txt | python enqueue_players.py $SQS_QUEUE_URL
```

Example file:

```
https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BradTo00.htm
https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MahoPa00.htm
```

---

# Scaling Strategy

Recommended configuration:

FlareSolverr containers:

```
3–10 instances
```

Scraper workers:

```
20–200 workers
```

Workers randomly connect to FlareSolverr endpoints to avoid Cloudflare throttling.

---

# Future Improvements

Recommended upgrades for a full production data pipeline:

• Automatic player discovery crawler
• Terraform infrastructure deployment
• Multi‑FlareSolverr load balancing
• Postgres warehouse for analytics
• Game log scraping
• Historical season scraping
• EventBridge scheduling
